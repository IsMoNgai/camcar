all the psram issue is because I selected the wrong board make sure your device target match the chip you are using

oct 27:
The esp documentation has a chatbot and apparently you need to enable psram with the require esp_psram in the cmakelist
PSRAM is fully setup: 
1. define it in the require in cmakelist in main root
2. enable it through the esp32 menuconfig ESP32 PSRAM under component config (you wont see this option without step 1). Make sure to save config
3. include it in the #include

I think the best way to maintain the project is to implment everythings in the OOP wrapped the C functionality and in appmain only use the class modules/components. Do not directly use the C low level functionality.

Project direction:
easy step first:
Keep MJPEG for videos + a websocket for command to control car
/stream -> MJPEG loop
/ws -> websocket endpoint for bidirectional control messages

A more advanced version which will be low latency setup:
do both MJPEN for videos and command to control car on websocket server.
